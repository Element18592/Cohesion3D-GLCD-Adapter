## Description
  
Since Cohesion3D is no longer selling these simple adapters that allow people to hook up a generic RepRapDiscount LCD to their $265 dollar controller board and refuses to release the pinout or gerbers, I’ve cloned it based on pinouts graciously provided by Ace_Archer_278521 and marcthijs.

Only 3 parts needed (both can be sourced from DigiKey):

1x PPTC062LFBN-RC

2x 61201021621
