## Description
  
Since Cohesion3D is no longer selling these simple adapters that allow people to hook up a generic RepRapDiscount LCD to their $265 dollar controller board and refuses to release the pinout or gerbers, I’ve cloned it based on pinouts graciously provided by Ace_Archer_278521 and marcthijs.

Only 3 parts needed (both can be sourced from DigiKey):

1x PPTC062LFBN-RC

2x 61201021621

You should also edit the config.txt file located on the Cohesion3D SD card and swap pin numbers for panel.encoder_a_pin and panel.encoder_b_pin

panel.encoder_a_pin should be 2.35 


panel.encoder_b_pin should be 3.26
